# BubbleSortVisualizer

Bubble sort visualizer with the purpose of a clean design and smooth functionality for an appealing and interactive user experience. The app includes a player with a play, next, reverse, skip and speed bar which the user can interact live while sorting a graph automatically. The app allows the user to create random sorted, nearly sorted (increasing & decreasing) and custom lists of integer inputs. It has a code and explanation tab which while sorting it simultaneously displays information accordingly. This was a challenging project due to the dynamic implementation of it which allowed me to learn, deeply understand and practice the use of custom complex animations, dynamic views, threads, OOP and more.

After checking other android visualizer apps, one of my main targets with this app was to give a good user experience, compared to other apps which lacked a appealing design, without basic to no appealing) animations and also lacking intereactive experince with the user.

Thanks for reading. :)
